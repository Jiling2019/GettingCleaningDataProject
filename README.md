This project is about preparing a tidy data set using "the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" from the site: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. The full data set description could be also found in the website.
The final tidy data set was generated by doing following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in previous step, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This repo includes the following files: 
1. README.md: Explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
2. CodeBook.md: Describes the variables, the data, and transformations or work that were performed to reach the tidy data set.
3. run_analysis.R: Shows R code with brief explanation for preparing the tidy data.
4. tidydata.txt: The final tidy data set.

More information and details about this project could be found in the CodeBook.md.
